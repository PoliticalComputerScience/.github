Political Computer Science @ Berkeley is a club dedicated to exploring interdisciplinary work connecting the technology and political fields. Don't be fooled, we have plenty of individuals with a strong tech background and host several web development/data science project each semester, but we also have room for individuals to explore non-technical projects relating to tech policy, and even code tools to help inform others about government.
